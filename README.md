# Godot_Game_Template
game layout testing and functionality


It was compiled in Godot, so your PC might warn for it being safe. I assure you it is. It used the rcedit.exe and standard windows godot template exporting. 

So this is an  initial template using gd script without any plugins specifically to create a template for player login authentication and allow for fire based data saving and loading as well as local app data user saves for general login credentials. It allows a simple flow of the process for a game structure with the ability to also purchase in game items with directivity towards paypal. The stats display is updated directly from firebase as well and the variables though differ from those in the main game selection window at the top, there will be a synchronization of those variables and maybe changes in names and types depending on how this will play out.

This will be used for a game eventually once all the fundamentals and functionalities are precise and error free which is the reason for my work in progress testing executable to check for any non functionalities or errors in input fields etc. The flow will take you all the way to a basic game scene where I'll have an option for 2D or 3D eventually but it'll show the assets on the side for an inventory during the game which are currently blank obviously and graphics have not been considered at all nor has any theme basis been considered yet just some simple graphical changes have been made temporarily to test their rendering structure and usability. I'm looking for feedback on this for mainly ease of use, errors, further implementations, et cetera.
